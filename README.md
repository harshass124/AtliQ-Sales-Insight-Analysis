## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware, a global provider of computer hardware and peripherals, is experiencing significant challenges as sales decline and business performance issues worsen. The sales director is finding it increasingly difficult to assess the overall health of the company and pinpoint the causes behind the declining sales. Whenever he seeks updates from regional managers, the information is often sugarcoated, with a focus on downplaying issues rather than addressing them head-on. The managers typically respond with large Excel files containing raw data, which adds to the difficulty of extracting meaningful insights and making informed decisions. The lack of transparency in these reports is a major source of frustration for the sales director, as interpreting numbers from spreadsheets without proper context or visualization is time-consuming and complex.

Additionally, the inconsistency in how data is reported across different regions further complicates the situation. This makes it challenging to compare performance metrics and identify which areas require immediate attention.

To address these issues, AtliQ Hardware needs a more efficient and transparent reporting system that offers real-time insights. This would empower the sales director to make data-driven decisions and take proactive steps to improve the companyâ€™s growth trajectory.
