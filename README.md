## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware, a global provider of computer hardware and peripherals, is experiencing significant challenges as sales decline and business performance issues worsen. The sales director is finding it increasingly difficult to assess the overall health of the company and pinpoint the causes behind the declining sales. Whenever he seeks updates from regional managers, the information is often sugarcoated, with a focus on downplaying issues rather than addressing them head-on. The managers typically respond with large Excel files containing raw data, which adds to the difficulty of extracting meaningful insights and making informed decisions. The lack of transparency in these reports is a major source of frustration for the sales director, as interpreting numbers from spreadsheets without proper context or visualization is time-consuming and complex.

Additionally, the inconsistency in how data is reported across different regions further complicates the situation. This makes it challenging to compare performance metrics and identify which areas require immediate attention.

To address these issues, AtliQ Hardware needs a more efficient and transparent reporting system that offers real-time insights. This would empower the sales director to make data-driven decisions and take proactive steps to improve the company’s growth trajectory.

## Importance of the Report


This report is crucial for identifying growth opportunities, optimizing sales strategies, and managing resources effectively. By offering an all-around view of AtliQ's sales data, it allows stakeholders to pinpoint areas for improvement and align their actions with business goals. The insights from this dashboard empower teams to make proactive decisions and increase operational efficiency across multiple branches, both in India and worldwide.


## Steps Followed in this Project

- Conducted a high-level analysis of the data in SQL to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
- Connected the SQL dataset to Power BI for further processing.
- Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data cleaning on the imported data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Standardized the currency by converting all transactions to a single currency, as the dataset initially contained multiple currencies.
- Created measures for various metrics and used them to develop visualizations in Power BI.
- Incorporated feedback from stakeholders by making necessary revisions to the initial report based on their review comments.

## Project Overview

I developed various report modes, including finance, sales, marketing, supply chain, and executive views, each tailored to provide insights specific to their respective fields.

## Dynamic Visualizations


This report features a diverse range of dynamic visuals designed to provide stakeholders with a deeper understanding of AtliQ's business insights. From trend analyses to customer and product segmentation, each visual is interactive and allows users to filter and drill down into specific data points. The report includes performance indicators across sales, customer preferences, product categories, and financial metrics, all dynamically linked to provide real-time insights as data is updated. These visuals enable stakeholders to explore and interpret data intuitively, driving better engagement and informed decision-making.

# Finance View
In the Net Sales Performance Over Time, you've tracked the trend of net sales from September 2020 to August 2021, comparing it with the benchmark. The graph reveals a peak in sales around December 2020, followed by a dip in early 2021, and then stable performance through the mid to later months of the year. This view also allows for a year-over-year comparison, giving insights into any seasonal patterns or fluctuations in sales performance relative to the benchmark, helping to identify key periods of growth or decline.

In the Profit and Loss Statement, you've analyzed key financial metrics, showing substantial growth across most areas for 2021 compared to the benchmark (BM). Gross sales increased by 210.60%, resulting in a considerable rise in net sales by 207.43%. Detailed breakdowns of pre-invoice and post-invoice deductions highlight factors impacting net invoice sales. Manufacturing, freight, and other costs contribute to the Total COGS, with a significant manufacturing cost increase of 241.17%. Gross margin also grew by 202.37%, though the gross margin percentage saw a minor decline of 0.61%. Overall, there’s a notable improvement in operational expense and net profit, turning previous losses into gains in 2021.
