## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware, a global provider of computer hardware and peripherals, is experiencing significant challenges as sales decline and business performance issues worsen. The sales director is finding it increasingly difficult to assess the overall health of the company and pinpoint the causes behind the declining sales. Whenever he seeks updates from regional managers, the information is often sugarcoated, with a focus on downplaying issues rather than addressing them head-on. The managers typically respond with large Excel files containing raw data, which adds to the difficulty of extracting meaningful insights and making informed decisions. The lack of transparency in these reports is a major source of frustration for the sales director, as interpreting numbers from spreadsheets without proper context or visualization is time-consuming and complex.

Additionally, the inconsistency in how data is reported across different regions further complicates the situation. This makes it challenging to compare performance metrics and identify which areas require immediate attention.

To address these issues, AtliQ Hardware needs a more efficient and transparent reporting system that offers real-time insights. This would empower the sales director to make data-driven decisions and take proactive steps to improve the company’s growth trajectory.

## Steps Followed in this Project

- Conducted a high-level analysis of the data in SQL to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
- Connected the SQL dataset to Power BI for further processing.
- Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data cleaning on the imported data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Standardized the currency by converting all transactions to a single currency, as the dataset initially contained multiple currencies.
- Created measures for various metrics and used them to develop visualizations in Power BI.
- Incorporated feedback from stakeholders by making necessary revisions to the initial report based on their review comments.

# Executive View
The executive view dashboard for AtliQ Hardware provides a concise summary of key business metrics, including net sales ($823.85M), gross margin (36.49%), net profit (-6.63%), and forecast accuracy (80.21%). It highlights regional performance, with India leading in sales, and shows revenue breakdowns by division and sales channels. The dashboard also tracks trends in revenue and market share from 2018 to 2022, along with top customers and products, offering a strategic overview in a single glance.
